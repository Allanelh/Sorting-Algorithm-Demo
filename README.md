# Sorting-Algorithm-Demo
Merge Sort implementation using recursion and merging in C++.

This repository contains a clean and well-documented implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm in C++.  
It demonstrates takes advantage of data structures, algorithms, recursion, and time complexity analysis.

---

## Features
- Implementation of **Merge Sort** using recursion and merging.
- Modern C++ practices** (`std::vector`, clear variable names, modular code).
- A Time Complexity of O(n log n).
- A Space Complexity of O(n) due to temporary storage during merging.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed, such as:
- g++ (Linux / macOS)
- MinGW or MSVC (Windows)

### Running the Program
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/merge-sort-cpp.git
   cd merge-sort-cpp/src
2. Compile the program:
  g++ main.cpp -o mergesort


3. Run the program:
  ./mergesort


Expected Output:
Sorted array: 5 12 22 45 60 78 90
